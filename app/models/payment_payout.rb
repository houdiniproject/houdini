# charge_payouts are a join table between charges and payouts
#
# The reason we need a join table between charges and payouts:
# A single charge can have multiple charge_payouts. For example, if we make a
# payout that later fails, we want to keep a record of all the charges for that
# failed payout. When the nonprofit later makes a second payout that succeeds,
# all those charges will now have to charge_payouts: one of the failed payout,
# and one for the succeeded payout
#
# It's also nice to keep a historical records of fees for individual donations
# since our fees will continue to change as our transaction volume increases
