  # The status is confusing here.
  # A recurring donation can be in one of four status'
  # * active
  # * cancelled
  # * failed
  # * fulfilled

  # the conditions for those statuses are as follows
  # if the field 'active' is false, then "cancelled"
  # else if n_failures is at least 3, then "failed"
  # else if the end_date is set and in the past, "fulfilled"
  # else "active"


  # The query that displays in nonprofits/:id/recurring_donations is rds that are active OR failed
