<p>Dear <%= @creator_profile.name.blank? ? @creator_profile.user.email : @creator_profile.name %>,</p>
<br>

<p>Congratulations on creating your campaign!</p>
<br>

<p>You can visit it here: <strong><a href='<%= campaign_url %>'><%= campaign_url %></a></strong></p>
<br>

<p>Before you share your campaign with the world, we have a few tips that could help the success of your campaign:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Use your campaign story to explain <strong>why</strong> supporters should give and <strong>how</strong> their contributions will be used.</li>
  <li>Make your campaign story more engaging with images and video.</li>
	<li>Create one-time or recurring gift options (recurring gift options are a powerful way to create sustainability for your organization).</li>
  <li>Get a few people in your network to make initial donations.</li>
  <li>Inform people in your network before your campaign launches so that they can be prepared to share it and contribute to it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once your campaign is ready to go, you can check the 'Publish' box on your campaign settings.</p>
<br>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can still share an unpublished campaign, but it will not show up on your nonprofit profile page or on your campaign listing page.</p>
<br>
