	<p>Before you can make payouts, we ask that you follow a two step verification process, which helps us prevent fraud.  Once the following steps are completed, you'll be able to make a payout any time with the click of a button and automatically receive deposits on the first of every month.</p>

	<p >Please note that the verification process with our donation processor (<a href='https://stripe.com/' target='_blank'>Stripe</a>), can take up to a day.  If you don't see the todo list items getting crossed off like you expect them to, please check back in a day.</p>
