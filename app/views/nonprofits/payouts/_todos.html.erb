	<p>Before you can <%unless [:temporarily_verified, :verified].include? @steps_to_payout[0][:status]-%>accept payments or <%end%>make payouts, we ask that you follow a short verification process, which helps us prevent fraud. Once the following steps are completed, you'll be able to make a payout any time with the click of a button and automatically receive deposits on the first of every month.</p>

	<p>Please note that the verification process with our donation processor (<a href='https://stripe.com/' target='_blank'>Stripe</a>) usually completes in less than 15 minutes. </p>
