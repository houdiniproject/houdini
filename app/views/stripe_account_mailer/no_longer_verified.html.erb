<p>Dear <%= @nonprofit.name %>,</p>

<p>Stripe, our payment provider, has requested that you provide additional information about your organization or account representative. This could be due to your account's volume or because complete information was not provided in your account's verification form. You can submit the additional verification by following this link: <%= link_to(confirm_nonprofits_stripe_account_url(@nonprofit), confirm_nonprofits_stripe_account_url(@nonprofit))%></p>

<p>Complete verification for your account is required for you to continue to use CommitChange’s Donate Button, campaign, and event features. <% if @deadline -%>
The deadline for finishing the verification process for your CommitChange account is <strong><%=  @deadline %></strong>. <% else -%>
You are advised to complete this verification as soon as possible.<% end -%>
</p>

<p>We appreciate the honor of serving all of our nonprofit and social venture organizations; if you have any questions about the new process or need help completing your form before the deadline, please reach out to the support team at <a href="mailto:<%= Settings.devise.mailer_sender %>"><%= Settings.devise.mailer_sender %></a>.</p>
