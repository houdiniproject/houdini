#Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
#and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
#than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#I18n.t 'hello'
#In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#<%= t('hello') %>
#To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#I18n.locale = :es
#This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
#the default I18n backend:
#true, false, on, off, yes, no
#Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#en_en:
#'true': 'foo'
#To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
#available at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.
