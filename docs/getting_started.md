# Getting Started

## Local Config

Instructions for running Development environment using macOS Catalina

### Initial steps

_Dependencies:_

Have a ruby version installed, you can learn more about how to use multiple
versions of Ruby installed in your computer with
[rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) or [rvm](https://rvm.io).

An instance of PostgresSQL running.

_Setting up secrets:_

Run `cp .env.template .env` to copy the provided template file for env
variables to create your own.

You'll need to provide a `DEVISE_SECRET_KEY` and `SECRET_TOKEN` which you can
obtain by running `bundle exec bin/rails secret`.

Set the following secrets in your `.env` file with your _Stripe account_ information.

* `STRIPE_API_KEY` with your Stripe _private_ key.
* `STRIPE_API_PUBLIC` with your Stripe _public_ key.

The last secrets you'll need are related to AWS. You can learn how
to [create an S3 Bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html)
within the AWS Documentation, and to obtain your access and secret key, you
can [learn more here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/wheres-my-secret-access-key/).

* `S3_BUCKET_NAME`
* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY`
* `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

### Database setup

Running `bin/setup` as per the README will in turn run `bin/rails db:setup` to
create the database, create the schema (tables etc), run all migrations and
pre-populate the database with some default values.

### Known issues

#### `database doesnt exist in bin/rails db create`

If you encounter `database doesnt exist in bin/rails db create` after running
both `bin/rails db:setup` and `bin/rails db:create`, you'll need to comment out
the lines these lines at `pg_type_map.rb`

```ruby
Qx.config(type_map: PG::BasicTypeMapForResults.new(ActiveRecord::Base.connection.raw_connection))
Qx.execute("SET TIME ZONE utc")
```

#### `relation "active_storage_blobs" does not exist`

This problem occurs when the database has been manually created, rather than
being created by `bin/setup`. This is due to a quirk with how `bin/rails
db:prepare` works when called in `bin/setup`. The `db:prepare` does one of two
things:

* if the database doesn't exist, it creates the database, loads the schema from
  scratch, which inherently includes all of the migrations, and runs the seed
  command (we don't really use that)
* if the database does exist, it runs any migrations that haven't been run
  already

The problem is when the database does exist but the schema hasn't been loaded
yet. In this situation, it tries to find what migrations need to be run, which
in this case happens to be all of them. But it doesn't have any tables to run
the migrations on so the entire thing fails.

As a work around, as long as all of the gems have been installed, run `bin/rails
db:schema:load` which loads the schema. At that point, if you run `bin/setup`
again, everything should be fine.

### Running in development

Run the development server with:

`bin/rails server`

The development server will periodically check for changes in CSS and JavaScript
assets and rebuild them in-process. If you are doing significant JavaScript
development and would like faster feedback on build errors and automatic
reloading, run `bin/webpack-dev-server` in a second console. Now after making a
change to the JavaScript code you should see Webpack immediately rebuild the
assets and perform a full page reload.

When in doubt, you can manually clear the generated CSS and JavaScript files
with `bin/rails assets:clobber`, which is a Rails [built-in command](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v6.0/command_line.html#rails-assets).

In development, it's **important** to access the Houdini at
`http://localhost:5000`, rather than the `http://127.0.0.1:5000` that Rails
suggests in the console. This ensures that the hard-coded callbacks in the
JavaScript code will work, such as during donation payment.

It's worth noting that the in-process build, the one-off `bin/webpack` build and
`bin/webpack-dev-server` build all set `NODE_ENV=development` which skips some
optimisation steps. The `bin/rake assets:precompile` task sets
`NODE_ENV=production`. When troubleshooting differences between development and
production builds, it may help to explicitly override the `NODE_ENV` environment
variable. For example:

`NODE_ENV=development bin/rake assets:precompile`

## Formatting

We are using [Standard](https://github.com/testdouble/standard) that is a
wrapper on top of Rubocop with a predefined set of Rules. If you use VS Code
you will want to install
[vscode-ruby](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rebornix.Ruby)
extension and enable formatting on save.

To enable formatting on save add these lines to your `settings.json`.

```json
{
  "[ruby]": {
    "editor.formatOnSave": true
  },
  "ruby.lint": {
    "rubocop": true
  },
  "ruby.format": "rubocop",
  "editor.formatOnSaveTimeout": 5000
}
```
